;                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
;                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
; 
;  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, INC. <http://fsf.org/>
;  Everyone is permitted To copy And distribute verbatim copies
;  of this license document, but changing it is Not allowed.
; 
;                             Preamble
; 
;   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license For
; software And other kinds of works.
; 
;   The licenses For most software And other practical works are designed
; To take away your freedom To share And change the works.  By contrast,
; the GNU General Public License is intended To guarantee your freedom To
; share And change all versions of a program--To make sure it remains free
; software For all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
; GNU General Public License For most of our software; it applies also to
; any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it To
; your programs, too.
; 
;   When we speak of free software, we are referring To freedom, Not
; price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed To make sure that you
; have the freedom To distribute copies of free software (And charge For
; them If you wish), that you receive source code Or can get it If you
; want it, that you can change the software Or use pieces of it IN new
; free programs, And that you know you can do these things.
; 
;   To protect your rights, we need To prevent others from denying you
; these rights Or asking you To surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
; certain responsibilities If you distribute copies of the software, Or If
; you modify it: responsibilities To respect the freedom of others.
; 
;   For example, If you distribute copies of such a program, whether
; gratis Or For a fee, you must pass on To the recipients the same
; freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
; OR can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
; know their rights.
; 
;   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights With two steps:
; (1) assert copyright on the software, And (2) offer you this License
; giving you legal permission To copy, distribute And/Or modify it.
; 
;   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
; that there is no warranty For this free software.  For both users' and
; authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
; changed, so that their problems will Not be attributed erroneously To
; authors of previous versions.
; 
;   Some devices are designed To deny users access To install Or run
; modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
; can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible With the aim of
; protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
; pattern of such abuse occurs IN the area of products For individuals To
; use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
; have designed this version of the GPL To prohibit the practice For those
; products.  If such problems arise substantially IN other domains, we
; stand ready To extend this provision To those domains IN future versions
; of the GPL, As needed To protect the freedom of users.
; 
;   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
; States should Not allow patents To restrict development And use of
; software on general-purpose computers, but IN those that do, we wish To
; avoid the special danger that patents applied To a free program could
; make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
; patents cannot be used To render the program non-free.
; 
;   The precise terms And conditions For copying, distribution And
; modification follow.
; 
;                        TERMS And CONDITIONS
; 
;   0. Definitions.
; 
;   "This License" refers To version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
; 
;   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply To other kinds of
; works, such As semiconductor masks.
; 
;   "The Program" refers To any copyrightable work licensed under this
; License.  Each licensee is addressed As "you".  "Licensees" And
; "recipients" may be individuals Or organizations.
; 
;   To "modify" a work means To copy from Or adapt all Or part of the work
; IN a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
; exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
; earlier work Or a work "based on" the earlier work.
; 
;   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program Or a work based
; on the Program.
; 
;   To "propagate" a work means To do anything With it that, without
; permission, would make you directly Or secondarily liable For
; infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
; computer Or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
; distribution (With Or without modification), making available To the
; public, And IN some countries other activities As well.
; 
;   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
; parties To make Or receive copies.  Mere interaction With a user through
; a computer network, With no transfer of a copy, is Not conveying.
; 
;   An interactive user Interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
; To the extent that it includes a convenient And prominently visible
; feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, And (2)
; tells the user that there is no warranty For the work (except To the
; extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
; work under this License, And how To view a copy of this License.  If
; the Interface presents a List of user commands Or options, such As a
; menu, a prominent item IN the List meets this criterion.
; 
;   1. Source Code.
; 
;   The "source code" For a work means the preferred form of the work
; For making modifications To it.  "Object code" means any non-source
; form of a work.
; 
;   A "Standard Interface" means an Interface that either is an official
; standard defined by a recognized standards body, Or, IN the Case of
; interfaces specified For a particular programming language, one that
; is widely used among developers working IN that language.
; 
;   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
; than the work As a whole, that (a) is included IN the normal form of
; packaging a Major Component, but which is Not part of that Major
; Component, And (b) serves only To enable use of the work With that
; Major Component, Or To implement a Standard Interface For which an
; implementation is available To the public IN source code form.  A
; "Major Component", IN this context, means a major essential component
; (kernel, window system, And so on) of the specific operating system
; (If any) on which the executable work runs, Or a compiler used To
; produce the work, Or an object code interpreter used To run it.
; 
;   The "Corresponding Source" For a work IN object code form means all
; the source code needed To generate, install, And (For an executable
; work) run the object code And To modify the work, including scripts To
; control those activities.  However, it does Not include the work's
; System Libraries, Or general-purpose tools Or generally available free
; programs which are used unmodified IN performing those activities but
; which are Not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
; includes Interface definition files associated With source files For
; the work, And the source code For Shared libraries And dynamically
; linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed To require,
; such As by intimate Data communication Or control flow between those
; subprograms And other parts of the work.
; 
;   The Corresponding Source need Not include anything that users
; can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
; Source.
; 
;   The Corresponding Source For a work IN source code form is that
; same work.
; 
;   2. Basic Permissions.
; 
;   All rights granted under this License are granted For the term of
; copyright on the Program, And are irrevocable provided the stated
; conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
; permission To run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
; covered work is covered by this License only If the output, given its
; content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
; rights of fair use Or other equivalent, As provided by copyright law.
; 
;   You may make, run And propagate covered works that you do Not
; convey, without conditions so long As your license otherwise remains
; IN force.  You may convey covered works To others For the sole purpose
; of having them make modifications exclusively For you, Or provide you
; With facilities For running those works, provided that you comply With
; the terms of this License IN conveying all material For which you do
; NOT control copyright.  Those thus making Or running the covered works
; For you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
; AND control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
; your copyrighted material outside their relationship With you.
; 
;   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
; the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is Not allowed; section 10
; makes it unnecessary.
; 
;   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
; 
;   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
; measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
; 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, Or
; similar laws prohibiting Or restricting circumvention of such
; measures.
; 
;   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power To forbid
; circumvention of technological measures To the extent such circumvention
; is effected by exercising rights under this License With respect To
; the covered work, And you disclaim any intention To limit operation Or
; modification of the work As a means of enforcing, against the work's
; users, your Or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
; technological measures.
; 
;   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
; 
;   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
; receive it, IN any medium, provided that you conspicuously And
; appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
; keep intact all notices stating that this License And any
; non-permissive terms added IN accord With section 7 apply To the code;
; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
; recipients a copy of this License along With the Program.
; 
;   You may charge any price Or no price For each copy that you convey,
; AND you may offer support Or warranty protection For a fee.
; 
;   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
; 
;   You may convey a work based on the Program, Or the modifications To
; produce it from the Program, IN the form of source code under the
; terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
; 
;     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
;     it, And giving a relevant date.
; 
;     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
;     released under this License And any conditions added under section
;     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement IN section 4 To
;     "keep intact all notices".
; 
;     c) You must license the entire work, As a whole, under this
;     License To anyone who comes INTO possession of a copy.  This
;     License will therefore apply, along With any applicable section 7
;     additional terms, To the whole of the work, And all its parts,
;     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
;     permission To license the work IN any other way, but it does Not
;     invalidate such permission If you have separately received it.
; 
;     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
;     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
;     interfaces that do Not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
;     work need Not make them do so.
; 
;   A compilation of a covered work With other separate And independent
; works, which are Not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
; AND which are Not combined With it such As To form a larger program,
; IN Or on a volume of a storage Or distribution medium, is called an
; "aggregate" If the compilation And its resulting copyright are Not
; used To limit the access Or legal rights of the compilation's users
; beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
; IN an aggregate does Not cause this License To apply To the other
; parts of the aggregate.
; 
;   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
; 
;   You may convey a covered work IN object code form under the terms
; of sections 4 And 5, provided that you also convey the
; machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
; IN one of these ways:
; 
;     a) Convey the object code IN, Or embodied IN, a physical product
;     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
;     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
;     customarily used For software interchange.
; 
;     b) Convey the object code IN, Or embodied IN, a physical product
;     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
;     written offer, valid For at least three years And valid For As
;     long As you offer spare parts Or customer support For that product
;     model, To give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
;     copy of the Corresponding Source For all the software IN the
;     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
;     medium customarily used For software interchange, For a price no
;     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
;     conveying of source, Or (2) access To copy the
;     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
; 
;     c) Convey individual copies of the object code With a copy of the
;     written offer To provide the Corresponding Source.  This
;     alternative is allowed only occasionally And noncommercially, And
;     only If you received the object code With such an offer, IN accord
;     With subsection 6b.
; 
;     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
;     place (gratis Or For a charge), And offer equivalent access To the
;     Corresponding Source IN the same way through the same place at no
;     further charge.  You need Not require recipients To copy the
;     Corresponding Source along With the object code.  If the place To
;     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
;     may be on a different server (operated by you Or a third party)
;     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
;     clear directions Next To the object code saying where To find the
;     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
;     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated To ensure that it is
;     available For As long As needed To satisfy these requirements.
; 
;     e) Convey the object code using peer-To-peer transmission, provided
;     you inform other peers where the object code And Corresponding
;     Source of the work are being offered To the general public at no
;     charge under subsection 6d.
; 
;   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
; from the Corresponding Source As a System Library, need Not be
; included IN conveying the object code work.
; 
;   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
; tangible personal property which is normally used For personal, family,
; OR household purposes, Or (2) anything designed Or sold For incorporation
; INTO a dwelling.  IN determining whether a product is a consumer product,
; doubtful cases shall be resolved IN favor of coverage.  For a particular
; product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers To a
; typical Or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
; of the particular user Or of the way IN which the particular user
; actually uses, Or expects Or is expected To use, the product.  A product
; is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
; commercial, industrial Or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
; the only significant mode of use of the product.
; 
;   "Installation Information" For a User Product means any methods,
; procedures, authorization keys, Or other information required To install
; AND execute modified versions of a covered work IN that User Product from
; a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
; suffice To ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
; code is IN no Case prevented Or interfered With solely because
; modification has been made.
; 
;   If you convey an object code work under this section IN, Or With, Or
; specifically For use IN, a User Product, And the conveying occurs As
; part of a transaction IN which the right of possession And use of the
; User Product is transferred To the recipient IN perpetuity Or For a
; fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
; Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
; by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does Not apply
; If neither you nor any third party retains the ability To install
; modified object code on the User Product (For example, the work has
; been installed IN ROM).
; 
;   The requirement To provide Installation Information does Not include a
; requirement To Continue To provide support service, warranty, Or updates
; For a work that has been modified Or installed by the recipient, Or For
; the User Product IN which it has been modified Or installed.  Access To a
; network may be denied when the modification itself materially And
; adversely affects the operation of the network Or violates the rules And
; protocols For communication across the network.
; 
;   Corresponding Source conveyed, And Installation Information provided,
; IN accord With this section must be IN a format that is publicly
; documented (And With an implementation available To the public IN
; source code form), And must require no special password Or key For
; unpacking, reading Or copying.
; 
;   7. Additional Terms.
; 
;   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
; License by making exceptions from one Or more of its conditions.
; Additional permissions that are applicable To the entire Program shall
; be treated As though they were included IN this License, To the extent
; that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
; apply only To part of the Program, that part may be used separately
; under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
; this License without regard To the additional permissions.
; 
;   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
; remove any additional permissions from that copy, Or from any part of
; it.  (Additional permissions may be written To require their own
; removal IN certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
; additional permissions on material, added by you To a covered work,
; For which you have Or can give appropriate copyright permission.
; 
;   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, For material you
; ADD To a covered work, you may (If authorized by the copyright holders of
; that material) supplement the terms of this License With terms:
; 
;     a) Disclaiming warranty Or limiting liability differently from the
;     terms of sections 15 And 16 of this License; or
; 
;     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices Or
;     author attributions IN that material Or IN the Appropriate Legal
;     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
; 
;     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, Or
;     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked IN
;     reasonable ways As different from the original version; or
; 
;     d) Limiting the use For publicity purposes of names of licensors Or
;     authors of the material; or
; 
;     e) Declining To grant rights under trademark law For use of some
;     trade names, trademarks, Or service marks; or
; 
;     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors And authors of that
;     material by anyone who conveys the material (Or modified versions of
;     it) With contractual assumptions of liability To the recipient, For
;     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
;     those licensors And authors.
; 
;   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
; restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
; received it, Or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
; governed by this License along With a term that is a further
; restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
; a further restriction but permits relicensing Or conveying under this
; License, you may ADD To a covered work material governed by the terms
; of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
; NOT survive such relicensing Or conveying.
; 
;   If you ADD terms To a covered work IN accord With this section, you
; must place, IN the relevant source files, a statement of the
; additional terms that apply To those files, Or a notice indicating
; where To find the applicable terms.
; 
;   Additional terms, permissive Or non-permissive, may be stated IN the
; form of a separately written license, Or stated As exceptions;
; the above requirements apply either way.
; 
;   8. Termination.
; 
;   You may Not propagate Or modify a covered work except As expressly
; provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise To propagate Or
; modify it is void, And will automatically terminate your rights under
; this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
; paragraph of section 11).
; 
;   However, If you cease all violation of this License, then your
; license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
; provisionally, unless And Until the copyright holder explicitly And
; finally terminates your license, And (b) permanently, If the copyright
; holder fails To notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
; prior To 60 days after the cessation.
; 
;   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
; reinstated permanently If the copyright holder notifies you of the
; violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
; received notice of violation of this License (For any work) from that
; copyright holder, And you cure the violation prior To 30 days after
; your receipt of the notice.
; 
;   Termination of your rights under this section does Not terminate the
; licenses of parties who have received copies Or rights from you under
; this License.  If your rights have been terminated And Not permanently
; reinstated, you do Not qualify To receive new licenses For the same
; material under section 10.
; 
;   9. Acceptance Not Required For Having Copies.
; 
;   You are Not required To accept this License IN order To receive Or
; run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
; occurring solely As a consequence of using peer-To-peer transmission
; To receive a copy likewise does Not require acceptance.  However,
; nothing other than this License grants you permission To propagate Or
; modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright If you do
; NOT accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying Or propagating a
; covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License To do so.
; 
;   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
; 
;   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
; receives a license from the original licensors, To run, modify And
; propagate that work, subject To this License.  You are Not responsible
; For enforcing compliance by third parties With this License.
; 
;   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
; organization, Or substantially all assets of one, Or subdividing an
; organization, Or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
; work results from an entity transaction, each party To that
; transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
; licenses To the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
; give under the previous paragraph, plus a right To possession of the
; Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor IN interest, If
; the predecessor has it Or can get it With reasonable efforts.
; 
;   You may Not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
; rights granted Or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
; NOT impose a license fee, royalty, Or other charge For exercise of
; rights granted under this License, And you may Not initiate litigation
; (including a cross-claim Or counterclaim IN a lawsuit) alleging that
; any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering For
; sale, Or importing the Program Or any portion of it.
; 
;   11. Patents.
; 
;   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
; License of the Program Or a work on which the Program is based.  The
; work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
; 
;   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
; owned Or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired Or
; hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
; by this License, of making, using, Or selling its contributor version,
; but do Not include claims that would be infringed only As a
; consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
; purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right To grant
; patent sublicenses IN a manner consistent With the requirements of
; this License.
; 
;   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
; patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
; make, use, sell, offer For sale, Import And otherwise run, modify And
; propagate the contents of its contributor version.
; 
;   IN the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
; agreement Or commitment, however denominated, Not To enforce a patent
; (such As an express permission To practice a patent Or covenant Not To
; sue For patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license To a
; party means To make such an agreement Or commitment Not To enforce a
; patent against the party.
; 
;   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
; AND the Corresponding Source of the work is Not available For anyone
; To copy, free of charge And under the terms of this License, through a
; publicly available network server Or other readily accessible means,
; then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source To be so
; available, Or (2) arrange To deprive yourself of the benefit of the
; patent license For this particular work, Or (3) arrange, IN a manner
; consistent With the requirements of this License, To extend the patent
; license To downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
; actual knowledge that, but For the patent license, your conveying the
; covered work IN a country, Or your recipient's use of the covered work
; IN a country, would infringe one Or more identifiable patents IN that
; country that you have reason To believe are valid.
; 
;   If, pursuant To Or IN connection With a single transaction Or
; arrangement, you convey, Or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
; covered work, And grant a patent license To some of the parties
; receiving the covered work authorizing them To use, propagate, modify
; OR convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
; you grant is automatically extended To all recipients of the covered
; work And works based on it.
; 
;   A patent license is "discriminatory" If it does Not include within
; the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, Or is
; conditioned on the non-exercise of one Or more of the rights that are
; specifically granted under this License.  You may Not convey a covered
; work If you are a party To an arrangement With a third party that is
; IN the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
; To the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
; the work, And under which the third party grants, To any of the
; parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
; patent license (a) IN connection With copies of the covered work
; conveyed by you (Or copies made from those copies), Or (b) primarily
; For And IN connection With specific products Or compilations that
; contain the covered work, unless you entered INTO that arrangement,
; OR that patent license was granted, prior To 28 March 2007.
; 
;   Nothing IN this License shall be construed As excluding Or limiting
; any implied license Or other defenses To infringement that may
; otherwise be available To you under applicable patent law.
; 
;   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
; 
;   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement Or
; otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do Not
; excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
; covered work so As To satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
; License And any other pertinent obligations, then As a consequence you may
; NOT convey it at all.  For example, If you agree To terms that obligate you
; To collect a royalty For further conveying from those To whom you convey
; the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms And this
; License would be To refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
; 
;   13. Use With the GNU Affero General Public License.
; 
;   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
; permission To link Or combine any covered work With a work licensed
; under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License INTO a single
; combined work, And To convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
; License will Continue To apply To the part which is the covered work,
; but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
; section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply To the
; combination As such.
; 
;   14. Revised Versions of this License.
; 
;   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised And/Or new versions of
; the GNU General Public License from time To time.  Such new versions will
; be similar IN spirit To the present version, but may differ IN detail To
; address new problems Or concerns.
; 
;   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
; Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
; Public License "or any later version" applies To it, you have the
; option of following the terms And conditions either of that numbered
; version Or of any later version published by the Free Software
; Foundation.  If the Program does Not specify a version number of the
; GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
; by the Free Software Foundation.
; 
;   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
; versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
; public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
; To choose that version For the Program.

; permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
; author Or copyright holder As a result of your choosing To follow a
; later version.

; 
;             How To Apply These Terms To Your New Programs
; 
;   If you develop a new program, And you want it To be of the greatest
; possible use To the public, the best way To achieve this is To make it
; free software which everyone can redistribute And change under these terms.
; 
;   To do so, attach the following notices To the program.  It is safest
; To attach them To the start of each source file To most effectively
; state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
; the "copyright" line And a pointer To where the full notice is found.
; 
;     <one line To give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
;     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
; 
;     This program is free software: you can redistribute it And/Or modify
;     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License As published by

;     (at your option) any later version.
;

;     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

;     along With this program.  If Not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
; 
; Also ADD information on how To contact you by electronic And paper mail.
; 
;   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
; notice like this when it starts IN an interactive mode:
; 
;     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
;     This program comes With ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
;     This is free software, And you are welcome To redistribute it
;     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
; 
; The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
; parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
; might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
; 
;   You should also get your employer (If you work As a programmer) Or school,
; If any, To sign a "copyright disclaimer" For the program, If necessary.

;   The GNU General Public License does Not permit incorporating your program
; INTO proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
; may consider it more useful To permit linking proprietary applications With
; the library.  If this is what you want To do, use the GNU Lesser General
; Public License instead of this License.  But first, please Read
