PureDent is *going* to be (yet another) identi.ca/statusnet client.

Pretty much, I don't have a decent client to use while I am on my work computer (which runs windows) so I am making my own.
The language isn't an open source compiler, but I like it quite a bit and I'm very familiar with it--but most importantly I should be able to get it going pretty quickly.

PureBasic.com if you want to look into that.  It cross-compiles, so I will be able to relase a Linux version also.

I strongly recommend using one of the following on Linux/GNU:
- Heybuddy
- Identicurse

Or on Android:
- Mustard

Those are the applications that I love and am influenced by strongly. Go flattr/paypal/send a postcard or something to those guys!
